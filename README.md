# Link Shortener
*Unfortunately, I don't know how to shorten `vercel` url, so in most cases this is not the most efficient url shortener*
This project was made for educationaly purposes, so I think it's ok

Also, if you encounter Error 500, it most likely means, that my planetscape database went to sleep mode, and can't be accesse, sorry

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Prisma

## Hosts
